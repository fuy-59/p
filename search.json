    "text": "A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called members or elements.\nThere are several ways to describe a set as illustrated in the following example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample: Describing Sets\n\n\n\nConsider an experiment of flipping a coin 2 times.\n\nThe set containing all possible outcomes. Denote this set by \\(S\\): \\[S=\\{(h,h),(t,t),(h,t),(t,h)\\}\\] where \\(h\\) means ‘head’ and \\(t\\) means ‘tail’. This is the roster method in which every element is listed.\nThe set containing the number of tails obtained. Denote this set by \\(N\\). Using the roster method, \\[N=\\{0,1,2\\}\\] or alternatively, using set builder notation, \\[N=\\{x\\mid x\\text{ is a non-negative integer less than or equal to }2\\}\\] or more compactly, \\[N=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+\\cup\\{0\\}\\mid x\\leq 2\\}\\] where obscure symbols will be discussed afterwards.\n\n\n\nIf an object \\(a\\) is a member of set \\(A\\), we denote this by \\(a\\in A\\). Otherwise, we denote by \\(a\\notin A\\). For example, \\((h,t)\\in S\\), \\(1\\in N\\) but \\(\\{1\\}\\notin N\\).\nThere are some predefined sets, denoted with blackboard bold fonts. * \\(\\mathbb{C}\\): the set of complex numbers * \\(\\mathbb{R}\\): the set of real numbers * \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\): the set of rational numbers",
